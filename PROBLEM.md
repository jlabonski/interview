API URL: https://6god8pgyzf.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/databases}

This mock api provides info about databases in our environment. You're going
to use it to retrieve information, sort it, and return to a user.  Write a
script that retrieves info from the API and prints out all database names,
their storage type, their used storage, and percentage of storage used. Sort
the output by storage used in descending order by percentage of storage used.
